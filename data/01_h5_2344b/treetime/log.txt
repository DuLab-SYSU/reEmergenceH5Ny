2.18	WARNING: Previous versions of TreeTime (<0.7.0) RECONSTRUCTED sequences of

    	behavior is some cases and is no longer done by default. If you want to
    	replace those ambiguous sites with their most likely state, rerun with
    	`reconstruct_tip_states=True` or `--reconstruct-tip-states`.
